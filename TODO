1) Get z formula in deleglise-rivat right:

   Currently: z = x / y + isqrt(x)
   Correct:   z = x / y
   
   This has to do with not using a lower bound for the sparse easy leaves.
   phi can only be calculated using look up if:
   
   x / n < prime * prime (or is it: next_prime * next_prime)

2) Why do I use in PhiCache::is_phi_bsearch(x, a):
   return x <= primes_.back() && x < isquare(primes_[a + 1]);
   Should it not be: x < isquare(primes_[a])
   
3) Update ./docs
   * write document about special leaves
   * write document about parallel S2(x, a)
