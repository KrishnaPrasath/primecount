# primecount build instructions

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed a C++ compiler which supports C++11 (or later) and CMake â‰¥ 3.4.

```bash
# macOS
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake

# Debian, Ubuntu
sudo apt install g++ cmake

# Fedora, Red Hat
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S gcc cmake
```

## Unix-like OSes

Open a terminal, cd into the primecount directory and run:

```bash
cmake .
make -j
sudo make install
```

## MinGW/MSYS2 (Windows)

Open a terminal, cd into the primecount directory and run:

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
make -j
sudo make install
```

## Microsoft Visual C++

First install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
(includes CMake) on your Windows PC. Then go to the start menu, select Visual
Studio and open a **x64 Command Prompt**. Now cd into the primecount directory
and run the commands below:

```bash
# Use 'cmake -G' to find your Visual Studio version
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" .
cmake --build . --config Release

# Optionally install using Admin shell
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

## Run the tests

Open a terminal, cd into the primecount directory and run:

```bash
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON .
make -j
ctest
```

## CMake configure options

By default the primecount binary, the static libprimecount and
libprimesieve will be built. The build options can be modified at
the configure step using e.g. ```cmake . -DBUILD_TESTS=ON```.

```CMake
option(WITH_POPCNT         "Enable POPCNT instruction"   ON)
option(WITH_LIBDIVIDE      "Use libdivide.h"             ON)
option(WITH_OPENMP         "Enable OpenMP support"       ON)
option(WITH_MPI            "Enable MPI support"          OFF)
option(BUILD_PRIMECOUNT    "Build primecount binary"     ON)
option(BUILD_LIBPRIMESIEVE "Build libprimesieve"         ON)
option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS   "Build shared libprimecount"  OFF)
option(BUILD_STATIC_LIBS   "Build static libprimecount"  ON)
option(BUILD_TESTS         "Build test programs"         OFF)
```

## Packaging primecount

When packaging primecount for e.g. a Linux distro it is best to change
a few of the default options.

primecount includes the libprimesieve dependency in its source tree and
libprimesieve is built by default. When packaging primecount it is better
to install libprimesieve using the package manager and not build
libprimesieve from source. You can achieve this using:

* ```cmake . -DBUILD_LIBPRIMESIEVE=OFF```

By default primecount builds the primecount binary and the static
libprimecount. Usually Linux distros don't want to package static
libraries. Hence you can build the primecount binary and the shared
libprimecount using:

* ```cmake . -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=OFF```

For performance reasons primecount uses the POPCNT instruction on
x86 CPUs. The POPCNT instruction was added to Intel's and AMD's CPUs
alongside the SSE4 instruction set in 2008. If you need to support
older x86 CPUs you can disable the POPCNT instruction using:

* ```cmake . -DWITH_POPCNT=OFF```

## Man page regeneration

primecount includes an up to date man page at ```doc/primecount.1```.
That man page has been generated from ```doc/primecount.txt``` using
the ```a2x``` program from the AsciiDoc package. Usually when packaging
primecount it is recommended to regenerate the man page. In order to
regenerate the man page you need to install the AsciiDoc package and
then build primecount (using e.g. cmake and make).

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install asciidoc-base

# Fedora
sudo dnf install asciidoc
```
