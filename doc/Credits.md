My thanks to the following people, without whom primecount wouldn't be what it is today. (Please let me know if I've mistakenly omitted anyone.)

* **David Baugh**<br/>
David was the most extensive user of primecount during early
development. He reported numerous bugs and suggested a lot
of useful features e.g. backup functionality, standalone
flags for all deleglise-rivat formulas. David also broke many
world records using primecount e.g. [A006880](https://oeis.org/A006880),
[A006988](https://oeis.org/A006988), [A122121](https://oeis.org/A122121),
[A040014](https://oeis.org/A040014).

* [Dana Jacobsen](https://github.com/danaj)<br/>
Dana explained to me in great detail the optimizations used in his
phi(x, a) implementation and also the implementation of the 
inverse logarithmic integral using Newton's method.
